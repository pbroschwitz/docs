By rolling out an open source "Customer Data Platform" into the organization's own data center every grain of data about customers is being collected and organized into a flexible graph-like data structure. Every interaction with every touchpoint and each change of master data is being reflected immediately in what is called the "Golden Customer Record". By organizing highly granular observations into meaningful attributes data-driven products become smarter and business intelligence gets more detailed.

The ability to disambiguate customer profiles across systems and devices is a key feature to deliver on this vision, especially when external data sources are incorporated. Other important features include easy-yet-flexible data preparation rules as well as machine learning engines that can infer missing attributes from other customer's records. Privacy-by-design according to European standards is front and center and allow to operate the platform even in regulation-dense industries.
