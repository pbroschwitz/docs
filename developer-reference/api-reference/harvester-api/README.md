# Harvester API

Harvester API consists of three separate sets of endpoints:

* [Source Types ](source-type-endpoints.md)to integrate data from external systems that can be used within
* [Harvester Instances](harvester-instance-endpoints.md) which transform incoming data and extracts metadata for matching
* [Event Types](event-type-endpoints/) representing raw data assets in Granary.
