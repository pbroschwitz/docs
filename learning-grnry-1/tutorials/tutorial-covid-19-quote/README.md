# Tutorial 1: COVID-19 Quote Calculation

## Calculate Quotation of COVID-19

Being able to calculate insurance premiums quickly and reliably is a challenge for any insurer; taking regional, even global, trends into account allows insurers to deliver the best possible quote to possible leads. In times of a global pandemic the need arises to relate the impact of COVID-19 with the calculated quote and adjust premiums accordingly.

This tutorial will guide you through an example pipeline which allows you to generate quotes in real-time, all powered by Granary.
