# Tracking Data

Currently we support Tracking of Web and App behaviour by Tracking methods that allow us to either channel a copy of the original tracking data or to directly send data to a Snowplow endpoint. Where the data is accepted and processed.

Current Tracking methods:

* Google Analytics for Web Tracking by using a Snowplow plugin
* Firebase Analytics by using Firebase Cloud Functions to send conversion events to our endpoint
* Snowplow for App and Web Tracking
