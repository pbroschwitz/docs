# Get Data Out of Granary

There are several ways to pull and leverage date stored in Granary. Each of them exposes an API. See:

* [Event Store API](../../developer-reference/api-reference/event-store-api.md)
* [Profile Store API](../../developer-reference/api-reference/profile-store-api.md)
* [Segment Store](../../developer-reference/dataflow/segment-store/) \(API access based on [Presto SQL](https://prestosql.io/)\)

The following pages contain a guide [how to model a segment](how-to-model-a-segment.md) in Granary and one that showcases [how to access a segment](segment-store-api.md) using Presto SQL with various clients.
