# Get Data Out of Granary

There are several ways to pull and leverage date stored in Granary. Each of them exposes an API. See:

* [Event Store API](../../developer-reference/api-reference/event-store-api.md)
* [Profile Store API](../../developer-reference/api-reference/profile-store-api.md)
* [Segment Store API](../../operator-reference/installation/segment-store-api.md)
  * To create segment tables a [kubernetes client environment has to be set up](../../operator-reference/installation/kubernetes-client-environment-set-up.md)
  * Segment definition is described [here](../../developer-reference/dataflow/segment-store/segment-table-creation.md) in the Data Flow Section
