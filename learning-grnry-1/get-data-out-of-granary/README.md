# Get Data Out of Granary

Granary has event and integrated profile data. Both of them can be retrieved in their original form via the Event or Profile Store API. Further, one can create so-called segments, which are use case specific views on the underlaying data. These segments are relation representations and can be queried via the Segment Store API. This API follows RBAC and can be used with  any JDBC client.
