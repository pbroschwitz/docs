# Prerequisites: Before we get started

### Postman

In order to play through this tutorial, we recommend postman in order to interact with the GRNRY RESTful APIs. Allmost every functionality is carried out via RESTful Services. If you are new to RESTful APIs, [this](https://www.w3schools.in/category/restful-web-services/) might be a good starting point to dive into the topic.

You can get Postman free [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Although you can use any other tool like curl or your browser's developer toolbar for sending http requests to GRNRY, Postman gives you the advantage that you can import a Postman collection.   
The GRNRY Postman collection consists of two files which contain all the URLs of the GRNRY environment plus the implemented methods for interaction with GRNRY. With the postman collection, a lot less typing will be needed in this tutorial.

The Postman collection can be downloaded [here](../../developer-reference/api-reference/#postman-collection)  and be ****installed like [this](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/data-formats/#importing-postman-data).

### Database Client

In order to view data in Grnry we will be using a Database client later in this tutorial in order to connect to a component called presto. We recommend using [DBVisualizer](https://www.dbvis.com/). 

### Browser

We will also be using a browser to interact with the GRNRY UI. Any modern browser will do. We recommend Chrome though.
